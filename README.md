# Graphics

This is a work-in-progress game engine, written in C# and GLSL through the OpenTK library.
This project is mostly meant to be a learning tool for myself.
The intent is to produce a library that can act as a base game library, with the ability to parse the associated common file formats (obj's for meshes, dae's for animations, etc.).

## Graphics

This is the library where all game engine code is being stored.

## GraphicsTest

This is a janky console application to launch directly into a test map.
All test resources are also stored here, such as textures, meshes, behaviors, etc.

## MappingTool

The Ghetto beginnings of a more user-friendly mapping interface.
Laughably useless at the moment, to be fleshed out later...
